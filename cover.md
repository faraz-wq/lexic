PTC Pune, India

##### Subject: Application for Software Specialist

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm Faraz Pathan, a recent Computer Engineering graduate with hands-on experience building and monitoring distributed systems. I would love to get a chance at this amazing opportunity to apply for Software Specialist role at PTC. I'm particularly drawn to PTC's mission of bridging physical and digital worlds through innovative software solutions.

**My relevant qualifications:**

- Developed a Kubernetes monitoring stack using Prometheus/Grafana to track cluster health metrics
- Built automated alerting systems for cloud infrastructure using Python and Azure APIs
- Implemented OpenTelemetry instrumentation in Node.js applications to monitor performance
- Created CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment times by 80% through automation
- Designed a cost-optimization dashboard for cloud resources using time-series data

My academic projects have given me practical experience with the full observability stack (metrics, logs, traces) and SRE principles. I'm particularly drawn to PTC's approach to unifying physical and digital systems, and I would welcome the opportunity to grow these skills under your guidance.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Faraz Pathan
